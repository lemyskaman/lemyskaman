# 👋 Hey, I'm Lemys

I'm a software developer who’s been around for a while, playing with computers and code, and delivering a wide range of IT solutions along the way.  
Over the last 10+ years, I’ve moved from hacking together scripts to designing and building **enterprise-grade systems** that solve real business problems.  

I enjoy the craft of software — especially **design patterns, architecture, and clean code principles** — because good design outlives any framework or language trend.
